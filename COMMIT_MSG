policy(agi): refresh governance policies and metacognition hook

Why
— Align the EEL, homeostasis, and sovereignty policies with the latest governance directives and hook the metacognition wrapper into the updated EEL signals.

What changed
— Updated /aig/eel_policy.json with the new capsule summary fields, privacy guardrails, and explicit metacognition hook contract.
— Tuned /aig/homeostasis.json thresholds and cautions to reflect the revised risk budget and escalation triggers.
— Refactored /aig/sovereignty_policy.json roles/escalations to capture the current acceptance, abstention, and audit paths.
— Extended /library/metacognition/metacognition.json to surface the EEL rehydration hook and expose the new governance toggles.

Scope/impact
— Governance and wrapper behavior only; no runtime code paths outside the policies and metacognition adapter are affected. Ensures consistent safety behavior across entities.

Next steps
— Monitor the next calibration run to confirm the new thresholds hold, and coordinate with AGI operators for any downstream entity handbooks that need syncing.
