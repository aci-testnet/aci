chore: ensure metacognition module JSON stays valid

Why
— Keep the metacognition wrapper definition strictly valid JSON by removing any stray commit message fragments.

What changed
— Confirmed the library/metacognition/metacognition.json file ends cleanly without the appended `# COMMIT_MSG` block that broke validation.
— Refilled COMMIT_MSG with the summary for this cleanup change.

Scope/impact
— Only touches the metacognition module definition and repository commit summary; no behavior changes.

Next steps
— None required beyond keeping validation checks in the pipeline to catch future JSON contamination.
