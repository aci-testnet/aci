docs(aci): add AGENTS.md — entities & agents guide for ACI contributors

Why
— Provide a single, human-readable map of how agents/entities operate in ACI: identities, governance, exports, wrappers/adapters, and pitfalls.

What changed
— Added AGENTS.md to the repo root:
  • Defines entity vs agent and the colony model (AGI governs; specialists execute)
  • Documents folder map (/entities, /library, /aig, /memory) with examples
  • Details identity/memory rules, export policy & filters, naming conventions
  • Captures governance & safety (sovereignty, homeostasis, EEL, playbook)
  • Lists common pitfalls and a contributor checklist
  • Provides JSONL event examples and a tiny diff snippet for Codex context

Scope/impact
— Documentation only; aligns with existing policies and modules. Serves as the canonical on-ramp for new agents/entities and contributors.
