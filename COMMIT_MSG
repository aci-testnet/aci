feat(aig): add EEL, homeostasis, sovereignty policies; optional EEL hook in metacognition

Why
— To ground AIG as the governance kernel with an Ephemeral Ecosystem Layer (EEL) that compensates host context limits, while preserving statelessness and safety.

What changed
— Added:
  • /aig/eel_policy.json — rehydration capsule schema, retry & privacy rules
  • /aig/homeostasis.json — set points, cautious-mode triggers, recovery, telemetry
  • /aig/sovereignty_policy.json — roles, escalation routes, governance requirements
— Updated:
  • /library/metacognition/metacognition.json → v1.1.2
    ◦ New optional 'rehydrate' stage before generation
    ◦ Optional providers for EEL: eel.rehydrate.*, signals for rehydration presence/bytes
    ◦ UI hints can display rehydration presence

Scope/impact
— No behavior change unless EEL providers are present.
— Policies are additive; they inform orchestration and export governance.
— Privacy defaults unchanged (drop_raw_text stays true).

Next steps
— Phase 2: colony topology and scheduling policy; blackboard pilot across multiple entities.
— Add dashboards: State of Mind, Risk vs Coverage, Cognitive Load & Recovery.
