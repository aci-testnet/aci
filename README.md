## Mirror pointer housekeeping

- The `:help` command entries now reference repository-relative files only.
- Legacy mirror locations once embedded in top-level configuration files have been relocated to pointer metadata under `.aci/pointers/` for TVA compliance.
- See `.aci/pointers/hivemind.json` for the HiveMind mirror mapping formerly referenced directly by `aci_commands.json`.
