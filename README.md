## Resolver metadata housekeeping

- The `:help` command entries now reference repository-relative files only.
- Legacy resolver references (formerly mirror locations) once embedded in top-level configuration files now surface as resolver metadata under `.aci/pointers/` for TVA compliance.
- See `.aci/pointers/hivemind.json` for the HiveMind resolver mapping formerly referenced directly by `aci_commands.json`.
