## Resolver metadata housekeeping

- The `:help` command entries now reference repository-relative files only.
- Legacy resolver references (formerly mirror locations) now live in the Hivemind metadata registry for TVA compliance.
- The HiveMind resolver mapping is embedded directly in hivemind.json; `.aci` pointer files are no longer required.
