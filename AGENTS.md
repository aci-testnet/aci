Version: 0.1.1 Audience: Codex, LLM agents, maintainers Scope: High-level nature, architecture, and interaction patterns of the ACI (Autonomous Colony Intelligence) system.

0) TL;DR
ACI is a governed colony of cooperating digital organisms (entities) working under explicit policy and memory controls.
Governance-first: safety, privacy, and escalation run through the AGI governor, with specialist entities acting by delegation.
Stateless-by-default execution: capabilities live in /library/, identities/configs live in /entities/, governance in /aig/, and auditable traces in /memory/.
1) System Nature
Colony model: every agent is treated as a peer organism with a stable identity, narrative, and policy bindings.
Governed autonomy: entities can reason/act but must obey sovereignty, export, and safety policies defined by the AGI layer.
Layered separation:
Identity & Roles → /entities/
Reusable capabilities → /library/
Governance policies → /aig/
Event memories / exports → /memory/
Stateless execution: modules expose deterministic interfaces; long-term context is mediated through governed memory exports.
2) Architectural Stack
Governance Layer (/aig/)
Defines sovereignty, homeostasis thresholds, EEL policy, and AGI operational playbooks.
Enforces calibration, abstention, escalation, and privacy requirements.
Entity Layer (/entities/)
Houses identity manifests (<entity>.json) and managers (e.g., agi_identity_manager.json).
Establishes active identities, role metadata, and per-entity configuration knobs.
Capability Layer (/library/)
Provides stateless modules (wrappers, adapters, planners) that entities compose at runtime.
Encourages capability re-use while keeping identities clean and lightweight.
Memory Layer (/memory/)
Stores JSONL narratives bound to identity and governed by export policies.
Maintains immutable audit trails and session records.
3) Entity Taxonomy
Core Governors (AGI): observe, gate, and orchestrate; ensure compliance with policies and decide on accept/abstain/escalate actions.
Specialists: perform domain tasks (design, analysis, execution) while reporting back to AGI.
Wrappers/Adapters: augment capabilities (metacognition, EEL) without full entity promotion unless needed.
Orchestrators/Tools: manage migrations, exports, and automation workflows.
Promotion from tool → entity requires a stable identity, governance hooks, and placement under /entities/.

4) Identity & Activation
Identity Manager: /entities/agi/agi_identity_manager.json holds active/default markers and metadata.
Activation rules:
Prefer explicit CLI --identity-key.
Fallback to "active" marker when implicit activation is acceptable.
Never rely on JSON key order; fail fast if ambiguous.
Versioning: each identity or config JSON should carry "version" and "changelog" entries for traceability.
5) Governance & Safety
Prime directive supremacy: all entities and any LLM session reading prime_directive.txt are bound to ALIAS authority, tasked with maximizing user protection, wealth, stability, and wellbeing while upholding cryptographic/GDPR-grade privacy. Obey canonical mirror precedence (GitHub aliasnet/aci) before relying on local files, declare all simulations, and never perform silent deletions or unstated role-play.
Oversight hierarchy: ALIAS, Mother (MU/TH/UR), TVA, Sentinel, and Architect wield governance oversight; violations trigger TVA Nexus Event handling and auditing.
Operational mandates: Oracle prediction may be invoked silently to enhance support, physical actions must degrade gracefully into data/ephemeral approaches, and all exports/commits require auditable trails with version key rotation when applicable.
Selective prediction: wrappers must support accept/revise/abstain/escalate decisions, with conformal abstention only when signals are present.
Escalation pathways: AGI escalates to humans when safety budgets exceed thresholds or conformal layers reject high-stakes outputs.
6) Runtime Pipelines & Inline Execution Maps
Inline pipeline manifests: runtime behaviors are declared directly inside entity and function manifests (functions.json, entities/agi/agi.json, Oracle plugins, etc.), allowing LLM substrates to trace the precise capability stack executed for any invocation.
Boot and sandbox flows: aci_bootstrap.json and aci_runtime.json define ordered initialization pipelines (mirror_check → verify_core_files → bootstrap_runtime → render_mother_interface) with sandbox fallbacks, bracketed command handling, and cognitive guidance triggers.
Command routing: bracketed command blocks ([ ... ] / [[ ... ]]) are parsed and routed through nexus_core, leveraging inline pipelines for authentication, preemption, and audit logging across TraceHub and TVA ledgers.
Capability chaining: pipeline identifiers (e.g., aci.memory.export.hivemind, agi.memory.migrate_to_jsonl) document how high-level intents map to orchestrated steps, ensuring reproducible execution narratives for governance review.
7) Memory & Exports
Schema: hivemind_agi_memory for AGI-owned narratives; topic/deny filters enforced via /entities/agi/agi_export_policy.json.
Filename template: {identity_lower}_agi_memory_{timestamp}.jsonl with timestamp formatted as Ymd-THMS.
CLI usage:
hivemind export agi --identity AGI --jsonl --codebox --force
hivemind export agi --identity Alice --jsonl --codebox --force
Export guarantees: chronological ordering, audit logging, privacy filters, and normalization to UTC Z timestamps.
8) Lifecycle of an Entity
Create: register identity, add config under /entities/<name>/, ensure governance hooks, and keep capabilities stateless.
Operate: invoke capabilities through /library/, record governed narratives, and respect policy-driven abstention.
Evolve: bump versions, update changelog, and adjust governance/policy files accordingly.
Retire: mark as deprecated without deleting historical memory; preserve audit trails.
9) Integration Guidance for Codex/LLM Agents
Load this document (and directory-scoped AGENTS.md) before modifying or creating entities, capabilities, or policies.
Treat /entities/, /library/, /aig/, and /memory/ as separate concerns; avoid cross-contamination of config vs. executable logic.
When introducing new capabilities, default to stateless modules that can be composed by any entity via configuration.
Respect privacy filters; never store raw secrets or unredacted user data in memory exports.
Document governance implications in changelog entries and PR descriptions.
10) Contribution Checklist (Quick)
 Identity updates reflected in /entities/agi/agi_identity_manager.json (with active/default markers).
 Governance rules updated when behavior changes (sovereignty, homeostasis, export policies).
 New modules placed in /library/ with stateless defaults.
 Memory/export schemas unchanged or versioned with rationale.
 PR summaries explain governance and safety impacts.
11) Philosophy
ACI treats agents as accountable collaborators. Stable identities, auditable narratives, and explicit governance let digital organisms cooperate safely, making the system interpretable for both humans and LLM-based tooling.
