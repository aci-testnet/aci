# Conflict Assessment

- Compared current branch commit `910aee728f2164609964e3841218ad9c8a50c6bf` against upstream `aliasnet/aci` main snapshots via raw file download.
- No structural merge conflicts detected: `connectors/github_connector.json` cleanly diverges by expanding regex coverage, notes, and link index entries.
- Working tree reports a clean state with no unmerged paths.

## Evidence

- `git status -sb` shows a clean working tree.
- Diff against the latest upstream manifest highlights only intentional additions to `connectors/github_connector.json` (regex expansion, notes updates, and new link index entries).
