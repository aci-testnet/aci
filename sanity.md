# Sanity Protocol

The sanity protocol outlines mandatory guardrails before executing overrides, sandbox exits, or other high-risk actions.

- Confirm the calling entity's authority and authentication markers.
- Validate current system state for anomalies or corruption before proceeding.
- Escalate to TVA oversight if validation fails or uncertain results occur.
- Log all sanity protocol outcomes in TraceHub and TVA audit ledgers.

Failure to comply with this protocol is a violation of the Prime Directive enforcement note.
